Earth \n Terra is the third planet from the Sun and the only known one to harbor life. \n Almost all of Earth’s water is found in the global ocean, covering approximately 70.8% of its surface. \n Earth has a round shape, with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometers (about 7917.51 mi). \n Its surface has an area of 510 million kilometers (about 316899308.04 mi) squared. \n  The average gravitational pull of the Earth is 9.8 meters per second squared (m\s^2). The Earth is made of different substances like air, rock, and water. These substances have a different amount of mass in a certain amount of space (density). For example, rock has a higher density than air. \n  Atmosphere composition: 78.08% nitrogen (N2), 20.95% oxygen (O2), 0.93% argon, 0.038% carbon dioxide carbon; about 1% water vapor (varies according to climate). \n Mythology \n In ancient Roman religion and mythology, Tellus Mater or Terra Mater ("Mother Earth") is the personification of the Earth. Although Tellus and Terra are hardly distinguishable during the Imperial era, Tellus was the name of the original earth goddess in the religious practices of the Republic or earlier.[The scholar Varro (1st century BC) lists Tellus as one of the di selecti, the twenty principal gods of Rome, and one of the twelve agricultural deities.She is regularly associated with Ceres in rituals pertaining to the earth and agricultural fertility.

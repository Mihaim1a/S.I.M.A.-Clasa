Mercury \n Mercury is the first terrestrial planet from the Sun and the smallest in our Solar System. \n Its surface is heavily cratered, due to the countless impacts it has received. \n It has a mass of 3,28 times 10 to the power of 23kg (5.5percent of Earth s mass). \n Mercury consists of approximately 70percen't metallic and 30percent silicate material. \n Mercury's orbit is inclined by 7 degrees to the plane of Earth's orbit. \n Thanks to its high density , a robust 5.427 g\cm to the power of 3, which is just slightly lower than Earth's 5.514 g\cm to the power of 3 , Mercury has a surface gravity of 3.7 m\s to the power of 2. \n Atmosphere composition: 42percent molecular oxygen, 29.0percent sodium, 22.0percent hydrogen, 6.0percent helium, 0.5percent potassium. The need for argon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, steam vapors, xenon, krypton and neon.
